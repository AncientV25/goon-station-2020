 == PREFACE ==
 
This document outlines how the ore generation for the fissile material ("nuke engine") subsystem 
should work. Ore should be generated in the normal mining magnet scheme where, upon mining magnet 
activation, a roll is performed to see how many (if any) fissile ores are generated. This will be 
expanded on shortly.

	Gaussian Rolls
	(ref: goonstation/code/unused/gaussianKernelProcs.dm)
	
Critical to the balance aspect of ore generation, you should learn and make use of the gaussian() 
proc which returns "random" numbers centered around a normal gaussian distribution curve. This is 
to say, unlike a normal rand() which returns any values between the boundaries at random intervals, 
gaussian() will return values mostly around the peak of the curve. For example, a curve centered 
around 50 should return most usually numbers 40-60, and much less usually any other numbers.

For better understanding, reference the below plot of a gaussian curve centered around 500 with a 
generous standard deviation (sigma):

	Nuclear Knobset

Please read the header in the above file, reprinted below:

				 This file defines a "knob set" datum containing
				 various coefficients/parameters/modifiers/factors
				 used by the nuclear engine. This is meant to
				 provide an easy, single interface for balancing
				 the reactor's operation in a gameplay context

				 This datum should only be instantiated ONCE per
				 game by the reactor (fchamber) New() function,
				 all consumers of the knobset should reference only
				 the fchamber's knobset. This ensures modifications
				 to the knobset affects all consumers equally.
				 */
 
You will need to create and access several variables in the above knobset following the format the 
established in the subsequent file. To access them, use the globally-defined nuke_knobs (in global.dm). 
This datum is created by the nuke, and should not be re-created.

 == IMPLEMENTATION ==

For every instance of the mining magnet being activated (a new asteroid being "sucked in" (generated), our code 
should roll to see how many/if any fissile materials are included. You should premise this likelihood on a knob 
variable as described above. For now, the rate you choose fissile ores to be generated at doesn't matter, but it 
should be defined as a knob so we can easily change it later.

Fissile ores should be generated as a generic "Unidentified Fissile Ore" or similar object. These objects should 
emit/inflict both regular radiation and neutron radiation to unprotected organic entities handling them directly. 

Define a class member variable to the nuclear ore type named "nuke_ore_quality" or similar. Assign it a value 
generated from the aforementioned gaussian system a number centered around 500 as in the above graph. This will be 
used to populate its nuclear material parameter values.
