TOOLS REFACTOR
==============

Make tools behave consistently via `tool_flags` var on `/obj/item`.
Deal with edge cases, e.g. improvised tools, surgery, insulated tools (wirecutters) vs. uninsulated (scissors).

MONKEY SUITS
============

Keep spriting monkey versions of any and all clothing.
Come up with a way to make hats look a little better (x-offset dependent on direction)

CYBORG REFACTOR
===============

Move cyborg tools around to make better modules.
Create generic omnitools to save slots (part of tools refactor) for medical omnitool and maybe others.
Whitelist items that work when part of a cyborg module, allow creation of random modules (found in crates).
